---

## Old business

 * Approval of minutes and agenda.
 * Revisit Closure/COVID Policies.
 	- No change in state guidelines since July.
 * CNC Update: Was Working with Issues in July. Justin/Tom?
 	- No update unless Justin or Tom logs in.
 * Weekly/Hourly Rates: Tied into door management issue. Richard was paused by work issues & unable to work on in June.
 	- No update yet; Richard is still working on work stuff. Will focus on weekly rates; hourly is not worth the effort and can be done as appointment w/ officer in exchange for donation.
 * Kits: Mia found the instructions on Wayback, is rewriting them with new pictures/video/etc. Will be able to sell through website when finished.
 	- No progress; sick kid.


## Finance

### Motions

### Reports

  * There is an old list of grant possibilities in the Financial folder in Officers drive. Someone should go through it and figure out what's active and what we're eligible for, and apply for things. These do not have to be the same person.
  	- Should ask for volunteers at September election meeting; can be part of finance subcommittee.
  * Re ColoradoGives.org: There is now an "approved by IRS for at least 5 years" clause in the eligibility requirements. As signups only run until August 31, we wouldn't be able to apply until 2022. What does our most current (2019) 990 look like? Are we close enough to $25k in net assets that we could get some donations and push the 2020 filing over? That would enable us to apply in 2021.
  	- Our IRS approval letter is dated September 6?, 2016. Zak will contact ColoradoGives.org and ask if we can still apply in 2021 even though we'll only be at 4 years and 51 weeks, or if we'll have to wait until 2022.

* Treasurer's report: We have about a $100 shortfall.
	- We're getting charged $20 by the bank; Zak will investigate and see why.


## Events
* Broomfield Days has been cancelled; there are no other events scheduled.

### Motions

## Education
	* We need a new Education coordinator; should add it to September election meeting if it's not already one of the elected positions.

## Outreach / Engagement

### Motions

### Reports
* Google Photos is active, "Member Makes" album is open for uploads. Photos can also be emailed to photos@thegizmodojo.com.

* We've talked about leaving a point-&-shoot at the space, asking members to take pictures of what they work on, & pulling things off the SD on a regular schedule. Anyone have a spare?
	- Zak donated a camera, Mia will get that set up.

* New wordpress website is up.  We need content (copy and photos).
  	- Mia downloaded the old site from Wayback; most of it is in wordpress anyway, can be used to fill in holes in current site. Will upload to the Officers drive.
	- Richard linked a draft, needs proofreading and copy. Can follow along in the #website channel on Slack to give feedback & provide copy.
	
* Member email lists: Mia & Richard will get off their butts and set this up. Will also set up an announcements list for non-members/general public.


## Space / Equipment

### Motions

### Reports
* We now have a large-format printer. It needs to be set up; software is available on Canon website or on included CDs.

* Laser: Laser is now connected to Asus laptop (battery & wifi don't work, so don't disconnect it!) with Inkscape & LaserCAD. Trial version of Lightburn is also there; Lightburn is $80 if we want to buy it.
	- Mia started playing with Lightburn and got distracted by sick kid, but so far it is a much better program than LaserCAD. 

* Cameras: There was a security-camera system in a box in the server room. Jeff checked it out and it works; they don't have a lot of storage, but recordings only need to stick around long enough to be looked at if something happens. Getting recordings off may be a pain in the ass, will be playing with them a bit more to see & also figure out settings & how many hours it will keep.
	- Someone needs to just get up and set this up.

* Vending Machine: Justin gave the board, as well as the connectors and pins to Tom. Justin does not require reimbursement.
