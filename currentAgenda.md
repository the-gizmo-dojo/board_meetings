# Agenda  - August 2020
August 3rd, 2020

---

## Old business

 * Approval of minutes and agenda.
 * Revisit Closure/COVID Policies.
 * CNC Update: Was Working with Issues in July. Justin/Tom?
 * Weekly/Hourly Rates: Tied into door management issue. Richard was paused by work issues & unable to work on in June.
 * Kits: Mia found the instructions on Wayback, is rewriting them with new pictures/video/etc. Will be able to sell through website when finished.



## Finance

### Motions

### Reports

  * There is an old list of grant possibilities in the Financial folder in Officers drive. Someone should go through it and figure out what's active and what we're eligible for, and apply for things. These do not have to be the same person.
  * Re ColoradoGives.org: There is now an "approved by IRS for at least 5 years" clause in the eligibility requirements. As signups only run until August 31, we wouldn't be able to apply until 2022. What does our most current (2019) 990 look like? Are we close enough to $25k in net assets that we could get some donations and push the 2020 filing over? That would enable us to apply in 2021.

## Outreach / Engagement

### Motions

### Reports
* Google Photos is active, "Member Makes" album is open for uploads. Photos can also be emailed to photos@thegizmodojo.com.

* We've talked about leaving a point-&-shoot at the space, asking members to take pictures of what they work on, & pulling things off the SD on a regular schedule. Anyone have a spare?

* New wordpress website is up.  We need content (copy and photos).
  - Mia downloaded the old site from Wayback; most of it is in wordpress anyway, can be used to fill in holes in current site.
	- look into Madwire's nonprofit plan? Madwire is in Loveland, has been working with CreatorSpace.


## Space / Equipment

### Motions

### Reports
* We now have a large-format printer. It needs to be set up; software is available on Canon website or on included CDs.

* Laser: Laser is now connected to Asus laptop (battery & wifi don't work, so don't disconnect it!) with Inkscape & LaserCAD. Trial version of Lightburn is also there; Lightburn is $80 if we want to buy it.

* Cameras: There was a security-camera system in a box in the server room. Jeff checked it out and it works; they don't have a lot of storage, but recordings only need to stick around long enough to be looked at if something happens. Getting recordings off may be a pain in the ass, will be playing with them a bit more to see & also figure out settings & how many hours it will keep.
