# Rules:
These are the rules that we expect all officers, members, and agents to follow.  It should be noted that rule 0 allows these rules to be expanded.

* Rule 0: Don’t make us make a new rule.
* Rule 1: Treat each other member with respect and dignity.
* Rule 2: Treat the space with respect.
* Rule 3: Clean up after yourself.
* Rule 4: If you are ever unsure about your ability to use a tool safely, stop and ask for help.
* Rule 5: Slurs (including but not limited to gendered, racial, and cis-heteronormative insults) will not be accepted.

# Reporting
If you feel like another member is violating these rules and you are not comfortable addressing them directly please inform one of the officers.  If you would rather make the complaint anonymously, you can create a fake email and send your complaint to officers@thegizmodojo.com.

It should be noted that rule 0 allows for members to report something that isn’t listed as a rule but should be considered.

# Remedies

Upon suspicion of violations an officer will have a conversation with the violating member.  That conversation will be documented.  If the reviewing officer feels that the violation was egregious enough they can meet with at least two other officers to discuss a temporary suspension.  The temporary suspension will last until the next scheduled officer’s meeting.

Each report will automatically create an item on the next agenda to discuss this.

If a member is temporarily suspended the officers will discuss the need to remove the member from The Gizmo Dojo during the next scheduled meeting.  The member is encouraged to attend that meeting and will be given time to speak.  If no vote is called at the next meeting regarding the suspension, the suspension will expire.  

The officers can decide if the member needs to be expelled from The Gizmo Dojo, extend the term of suspension (not to include indefinite suspension), remove the member from Slack, or that no further action is required.
