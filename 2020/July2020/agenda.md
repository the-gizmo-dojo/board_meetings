Closed 7:00pm.

---

## Old business

 * Approval of minutes and agenda.
 * Revisit closure.
    * Motion to reopen the space for meetings and classes. --No change. Revisit next month.
 * CNC
 	-- Working with a few issues; Tom & Justin are working on it.
	-- Replacement will not be decided tonight; will be revisited, possibly at special meeting.

## Finance
* We should revisit offering weekly/hourly rates. 
	* Con: Key management. We could charge a deposit for the RFID tags (which isn't a bad idea anyway), but would need to be able to get into the database and deactivate them manually if not returned.
	* Hourly rates would be simpler; just give folks the ability to come in and work during open houses, or make appointment to have someone meet them at the space. Loveland has "some tools" available for free during open houses; could get more info & model off that.
	* Make weekly rate around $15, so it's cheaper to buy month if they're going to use more than 1-2. 
	* Pro: Might convert into subscriptions.

-- This is tied into the door management; if we can log in to the Pi remotely and manage access it'll be much easier. Richard is working on this, and has been paused by work concerns. Will report back in next month.

### Motions

### Reports
-- Not much new on finances; running abt $200 under. Need members or some other sort of income, preferably both.

* Tom dropped off a bunch of things he found while cleaning, including some catapult/ballista kits. Need to find/reconstruct assembly instructions (were on old website) then can sell. Cutfiles are on the Public Drive in PDF format, will need to be converted to make more. Also have bag of misc parts, may be able to put more kits together.
	- mia found assembly instructions, need to be updated and have new photos taken, then we can sell through website

## Events

### Motions

### Reports

## Education

### Motions

### Reports
* Erin is no longer able to be Education coordinator; work got in the way.
- will try asking again if anyone wants to take over

## Outreach / Engagement

### Motions

### Reports
* Mia & Richard talked about leaving a point-&-shoot at the space, asking members to take pictures of what they work on, & pulling things off the SD on a regular schedule. Richard said he might have a spare?

* New wordpress website is up.  We need content (copy and photos).
	- a lot of the old content is on Wayback; should be downloaded anyway, and can be used to fill in the current site
	- look into Madwire's nonprofit plan? Madwire is in Loveland, has been working with CreatorSpace.

## Space / Equipment

### Motions
* Cameras. Wyze is $20 each ($30 for pan), has motion & sound detection, saves events to cloud. Free account only saves 12seconds per event, but all footage is saved to internal SD card. Propose one for 3d printers, one for woodshop, one for laser cutter to start, can add more later if necessary.

-

### Reports
* Andy Taylor donated a lot of tools, including two metal cutoff-saws, reciprocating saw, Dremel, and a portable compressor. The rest are still being gone through.

* Network has been labeled and a new Server is installed. This will be the door server, and we may be able to run the Canon off of it too.
	- Need to set up users & access, needs configuring for web & Pi access.
